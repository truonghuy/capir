We propose the CAPIR framework \r\n(Collaborative Action Planner using Intention Recognition) to solve this problem \r\nby tracking the assisted agent's intention using inverse planning (a concept \r\ninherited from cognitive science), and constructing actions based on the \r\nassistant's belief on the agent's intended goal and its knowledge of solving \r\neach goal (modeled as a Markov decision process). For complicated goals that yield \r\nlarge planning space, simulation-based algorithms are devised to approximately \r\nsolve the goals online. Evaluation with human players in an experiment game shows \r\nthat the assistant's resultant course of actions is near human-level.\r\n\r\n#### Related Publications\r\n\r\n* Truong-Huy D.
